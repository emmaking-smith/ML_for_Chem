# Course Materials Site for Machine Learning for Chemists
Hello All!  Thank you for taking the time out of your day to be guinea pigs for this course. I'll be uploading the Live Demos, a worked through demo (should I run out of time or forget something at the end of the lecture) and the lecture slides for each course.

The lecture recordings will likely be handled by Chung Tu ct465[at]cam.ac.uk.

If any of you would like to get in touch we me, please feel free to email at: esk[at]cam.ac.uk.
