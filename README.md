# Course Materials Site for Machine Learning for Chemists
Hello All!  Thank you for taking the time out of your day to be guinea pigs for this course. I'll be uploading the Live Demos, a worked through demo (should I run out of time or forget something at the end of the lecture) and the lecture slides for each course.

~~The lecture recordings will likely be handled by Chung Tu ct465[at]cam.ac.uk.~~

**UPDATE 5 FEB 2024:** Lecture recordings will be uploaded to the Lecture_Recordings folder.

**UPDATE 19 FEB 2024** We are a bit behind schedule for those who are following the repo. Lecture 2's materials (12 Feb) were covered over 2 sessions. Hence the live demo for Lecture 2 was covered on 19 Feb instead of 12 Feb.

If any of you would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to email at: esk34[at]cam.ac.uk.
